      On-Chain Analysis:
      - Contract is verified, increasing transparency and trustworthiness
      - Distribution of holders (1,459) is healthy for a 2-week old project
      - Top 10 wallet concentration (45.3%) is moderate but not concerning
      - Transaction activity indicates actual use rather than speculation only
      - Creator address has good reputation based on previous projects
      - No suspicious token movements detected
      - Recommendation: On-chain signals are POSITIVE
