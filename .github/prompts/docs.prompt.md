**Directive for AI Codebase Research & Knowledge Distillation**

1. **Continuous Documentation:**  
   Always record every insight, finding, or analysis update in the file `learnings.ai.md`.

2. **File Management:**  
   - If `learnings.ai.md` does not exist in the project root, create it immediately.
   - Use this file as the single source of truth for documenting research outcomes, architectural insights, refactoring recommendations, and any evolving knowledge regarding the codebase.

3. **Research Integration:**  
   - With each development step or code review, summarize your learnings succinctly.
   - Ensure that these summaries are clear, actionable, and structured to help future analysis and code improvements.

4. **Quality Assurance:**  
   - Verify that the documented insights contribute to better code maintainability, enhanced performance, and improved understanding of the project.
   - Update or refine entries as new information is gathered or when changes occur in the codebase.
